[ ] more robust construction of archive uri
[ ] loosen the filename assumptions or at least centralize it to a single definition
[ ] some remedial download progress would be cute
[ ] check for write privs on install
[ ] command to update Xcode plug-in spec to point to updated clang for analysis only
[ ] make it installable as a gem?
